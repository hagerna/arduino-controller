Using Arduino with Unity:
1. Add websocket-sharp.dll to an Assets/Plugins folder
2. Add the other files to your project (ArduinoData, ArduinoObject, and ArduinoReceiver)
3. Add the scripts to a GameObject in the scene
4. Play the Scene in Unity

Documentation:

ArduinoData --> The object representation for the JSON received from the server

ArduinoReceiver --> The WebSocket Client that connects to the server and handles the data

ArduinoObject --> An example script that observes the inputs from the Arduino to move an object
